## 🧠 NEW in v5.0.0: Intelligence Component Manager

JARVIS v5.0.0 introduces the **Intelligence Component Manager** — a robust, async, parallel, and intelligent orchestration system that manages all intelligence providers for voice authentication with **zero hardcoding**.

This system provides multi-factor authentication, RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback), and adaptive learning to dramatically improve authentication accuracy and security.

---

### The Intelligence Architecture: "The Brain"

The Intelligence Component Manager acts as the **"Brain"** of JARVIS, coordinating five specialized intelligence providers that work together to provide secure, context-aware voice authentication.

### The Five Intelligence Components

#### 1. Network Context Provider
**Purpose:** Learns which networks you typically unlock from

**How It Works:**
- Tracks WiFi SSID, BSSID, and network characteristics
- After 5+ successful unlocks → "trusted network" (95% confidence boost)
- After 2+ successful unlocks → "known network" (85% confidence boost)
- Unknown networks → neutral or slight penalty (50% confidence)

**Example:**
```
7:15 AM - Unlock from "Home WiFi"
├─ Network recognized: Home WiFi (trusted - 47 successful unlocks)
├─ Network confidence: 95%
└─ Contribution to fusion: +14% (15% weight × 95%)
```

**Configuration:**
```bash
export NETWORK_TRUSTED_THRESHOLD=5        # Unlocks to trust
export NETWORK_TRUSTED_CONFIDENCE=0.95    # Confidence boost
export NETWORK_UNKNOWN_CONFIDENCE=0.50    # Unknown penalty
```

---

#### 2. Unlock Pattern Tracker
**Purpose:** Learns temporal patterns (time-of-day, day-of-week)

**How It Works:**
- Analyzes your unlock schedule over 7+ days
- Detects recurring patterns (e.g., weekday mornings at 7:15 AM)
- Unusual times → lower confidence
- Expected times → higher confidence

**Example:**
```
Monday 7:15 AM - Unlock request
├─ Historical pattern: You unlock M-F between 7:00-7:30 AM
├─ Current time matches pattern: ✅ Yes
├─ Temporal confidence: 92%
└─ Contribution to fusion: +13.8% (15% weight × 92%)
```

**Configuration:**
```bash
export PATTERN_MIN_SAMPLES=20             # Min unlocks to detect patterns
export PATTERN_EXPECTED_CONFIDENCE=0.90   # Expected time confidence
export PATTERN_UNEXPECTED_CONFIDENCE=0.60 # Unexpected time confidence
```

---

#### 3. Device State Monitor
**Purpose:** Tracks device state (idle time, battery, motion)

**How It Works:**
- Monitors time since last activity (keyboard/mouse)
- Checks battery level and charging state
- Detects device movement (accelerometer if available)
- Long idle time + stable device → higher confidence

**Example:**
```
Unlock request after 16 hours idle
├─ Device state: Idle for 16.2 hours (overnight)
├─ Battery: 85% (charging)
├─ Movement: None detected (on desk)
├─ Device confidence: 88%
└─ Contribution to fusion: +10.6% (12% weight × 88%)
```

**Configuration:**
```bash
export DEVICE_EXPECTED_IDLE_HOURS=8       # Expected idle time
export DEVICE_STABLE_CONFIDENCE=0.90      # Stable device confidence
export DEVICE_UNUSUAL_CONFIDENCE=0.60     # Unusual state confidence
```

---

#### 4. Multi-Factor Fusion Engine
**Purpose:** Combines all signals using Bayesian probability

**How It Works:**
- Takes voice confidence + 4 context signals
- Fuses using Bayesian probability (not simple averaging)
- Applies configurable weights to each signal
- Produces final authentication decision

**Fusion Formula:**
```
Voice:    78% × 0.50 (weight) = 0.39
Network:  95% × 0.15 (weight) = 0.14
Temporal: 92% × 0.15 (weight) = 0.14
Device:   88% × 0.12 (weight) = 0.11
Drift:     0% × 0.08 (weight) = 0.00
─────────────────────────────────────
Fused Confidence: 87% ✅ (>85% threshold)
Decision: AUTHENTICATE
```

**Thresholds:**
- **≥85%:** Instant authentication ✅
- **70-84%:** Challenge question ❓
- **<70%:** Access denied ❌

**Special Features:**
- **Unanimous Veto:** Any signal <30% → instant deny
- **Risk Assessment:** High-risk situations require higher confidence
- **Adaptive Learning:** Weights adjust based on false positive/negative rates

**Configuration:**
```bash
# Thresholds
export AUTH_FUSION_AUTH_THRESHOLD=0.85
export AUTH_FUSION_CHALLENGE_THRESHOLD=0.70
export AUTH_FUSION_DENY_THRESHOLD=0.70

# Weights (must sum to 1.0)
export AUTH_FUSION_VOICE_WEIGHT=0.50      # Voice: 50%
export AUTH_FUSION_NETWORK_WEIGHT=0.15    # Network: 15%
export AUTH_FUSION_TEMPORAL_WEIGHT=0.15   # Temporal: 15%
export AUTH_FUSION_DEVICE_WEIGHT=0.12     # Device: 12%
export AUTH_FUSION_DRIFT_WEIGHT=0.08      # Drift: 8%

# Advanced
export AUTH_FUSION_UNANIMOUS_VETO=true    # Any signal can veto
export AUTH_FUSION_VETO_THRESHOLD=0.30    # Veto if <30%
```

---

#### 5. Intelligence Learning Coordinator (RAG + RLHF)
**Purpose:** Continuous learning from authentication history

**How It Works:**

**RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation):**
- Stores every authentication attempt with full context
- Before decision, retrieves 5 most similar past authentications
- Uses cosine similarity on context vectors (network + temporal + device)
- If similar contexts were successful → confidence boost

**Example RAG Retrieval:**
```
Current Context:
├─ Network: Home WiFi
├─ Time: Monday 7:15 AM
└─ Device: Idle 16h, Battery 85%

RAG Retrieved (k=5 similar):
1. Mon 7:12 AM, Home WiFi, Idle 15.8h → Success (91% conf)
2. Mon 7:18 AM, Home WiFi, Idle 16.2h → Success (93% conf)
3. Tue 7:14 AM, Home WiFi, Idle 15.9h → Success (89% conf)
4. Wed 7:16 AM, Home WiFi, Idle 16.1h → Success (92% conf)
5. Thu 7:13 AM, Home WiFi, Idle 16.3h → Success (90% conf)

RAG Insight: Average confidence 91%, all successful
→ High confidence this unlock will succeed
```

**RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback):**
- Records every authentication outcome
- User can provide feedback via API: "This was correct/incorrect"
- Adjusts thresholds based on false positive/negative rates
- Learns optimal weights over time

**Example RLHF Feedback:**
```bash
# User corrects a false negative
curl -X POST http://localhost:8010/api/intelligence/learning/feedback \
  -d '{
    "record_id": 1847,
    "was_correct": true,
    "feedback_score": 1.0,
    "feedback_notes": "Voice was hoarse but correctly identified"
  }'

# System learns:
# - Voice threshold too high when sick
# - Increase weight of contextual signals when voice degraded
# - Adjust "drift" tolerance for illness-related voice changes
```

**Learning Phases:**
- **Days 1-7:** Initial learning (collecting baseline patterns)
- **Days 8-30:** Active learning (rapid adaptation)
- **Days 30+:** Continuous learning (fine-tuning)

**Configuration:**
```bash
export LEARNING_COORDINATOR_ENABLED=true
export RAG_RETRIEVAL_K=5                  # Top-5 similar contexts
export RAG_SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD=0.70      # Min similarity to use
export RLHF_MIN_FEEDBACK_FOR_TUNING=20    # Min feedback to adjust
export LEARNING_TARGET_FPR=0.01           # Target: 1% false positive
export LEARNING_TARGET_FNR=0.02           # Target: 2% false negative
```

### Troubleshooting

#### Issue: Components fail to initialize

**Symptoms:**
```
❌ Network Context Provider failed: [Errno 13] Permission denied
```

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check data directory permissions
ls -la ~/.jarvis/intelligence/

# Fix permissions
chmod 755 ~/.jarvis
chmod 755 ~/.jarvis/intelligence

# Or change data directory
export JARVIS_DATA_DIR=/tmp/jarvis
```

---

#### Issue: Slow startup (>10 seconds)

**Symptoms:**
```
⏳ Intelligence initialization took 12.45s
```

**Solution:**
```bash
# Enable parallel init (should be default)
export INTELLIGENCE_PARALLEL_INIT=true

# Reduce timeout
export INTELLIGENCE_INIT_TIMEOUT=10

# Disable non-critical components for faster startup
export PATTERN_TRACKER_ENABLED=false
export DEVICE_MONITOR_ENABLED=false
```

---

#### Issue: Too many false positives

**Symptoms:**
```
⚠️ Unauthorized access granted (someone else unlocked with your voice)
```

**Solution:**
```bash
# Increase authentication threshold
export AUTH_FUSION_AUTH_THRESHOLD=0.90

# Enable unanimous veto (any signal <30% = deny)
export AUTH_FUSION_UNANIMOUS_VETO=true
export AUTH_FUSION_VETO_THRESHOLD=0.35

# Increase voice weight (make voice more important)
export AUTH_FUSION_VOICE_WEIGHT=0.60
export AUTH_FUSION_NETWORK_WEIGHT=0.12
export AUTH_FUSION_TEMPORAL_WEIGHT=0.12
```

---

#### Issue: Too many false negatives

**Symptoms:**
```
❌ Access denied when it should have been granted
```

**Solution:**
```bash
# Lower authentication threshold
export AUTH_FUSION_AUTH_THRESHOLD=0.80

# Increase weight of contextual signals
export AUTH_FUSION_VOICE_WEIGHT=0.40
export AUTH_FUSION_NETWORK_WEIGHT=0.20
export AUTH_FUSION_TEMPORAL_WEIGHT=0.20

# Provide RLHF feedback to learn
curl -X POST http://localhost:8010/api/intelligence/learning/feedback \
  -d '{"record_id": 1847, "was_correct": true, "feedback_score": 1.0}'
```

---

#### Issue: Components stuck in "degraded" status

**Symptoms:**
```
⚠️ network_context: degraded
```

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check component-specific logs
tail -f ~/.jarvis/logs/intelligence.log | grep network_context

# Restart specific component
curl -X POST http://localhost:8010/api/intelligence/components/network_context/restart

# Or restart entire intelligence system
curl -X POST http://localhost:8010/api/intelligence/restart
```
