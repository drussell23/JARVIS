# JARVIS Narrator Enhancements v6.2 - Visual Security Voice Announcements

**Version**: 6.2.0
**Date**: 2025-12-26
**Status**: ✅ Production Ready

---

## Overview

Enhanced JARVIS narrator with intelligent voice announcements for the v6.2 Visual Security and Cross-Repo Integration features. JARVIS will now speak during startup to inform you about security initialization, visual threat detection capabilities, and multi-system connections.

---

## What You'll Hear During Startup

### 1. Two-Tier Security Initialization

**When**: At 82% startup progress

**JARVIS says**:
> "Initializing two-tier security architecture."

**What's happening**:
- JARVIS is preparing the dual-mode security system
- Tier 1 (safe commands) and Tier 2 (agentic commands) are being set up

---

### 2. Agentic Watchdog Ready

**When**: After watchdog initialization (83% progress)

**JARVIS says**:
> "Agentic watchdog armed. Kill switch ready."

**What's happening**:
- The safety monitoring system is now active
- Heartbeat tracking and activity rate limiting enabled
- Kill switch armed to stop runaway processes

**What this protects you from**:
- Infinite loops in agentic tasks
- Click storms (computer use going crazy)
- Runaway AI behavior

---

### 3. Voice Biometric Authentication Ready (WITH Visual Security)

**When**: After VBIA adapter initialization (85% progress)

**JARVIS says** (if visual security enabled):
> "Voice biometric authentication ready. Visual threat detection enabled."

**OR** (if visual security disabled):
> "Voice biometric authentication ready. Tiered thresholds configured."

**What's happening**:
- Voice authentication is now operational
- Visual security analyzer is ready to screen your display
- Multi-factor authentication active (voice + liveness + visual)

**What this means**:
- ✅ JARVIS can now verify your voice
- ✅ Visual threat detection watching for ransomware/fake screens
- ✅ Tiered thresholds: 70% for basic, 85% for advanced commands

---

### 4. Cross-Repository Integration Complete

**When**: After cross-repo state initialization (86% progress)

**JARVIS says**:
> "Cross-repository integration complete. Intelligence shared across all platforms."

**What's happening**:
- JARVIS, JARVIS Prime, and Reactor Core are now connected
- Real-time event sharing enabled via `~/.jarvis/cross_repo/`
- Visual security events flowing to all systems

**What this enables**:
- ✅ JARVIS Prime can delegate voice auth tasks to main JARVIS
- ✅ Reactor Core monitors threats and analyzes patterns
- ✅ All three systems working together in harmony

---

### 5. Two-Tier Security Fully Operational (Final)

**When**: After two-tier router initialization (89% progress)

**JARVIS says** (if visual security enabled):
> "Two-tier security fully operational. I'm protected by voice biometrics and visual threat detection."

**OR** (if visual security disabled):
> "Two-tier security fully operational. Safe mode and agentic mode ready."

**What's happening**:
- Complete two-tier architecture is now active
- All security components initialized and coordinated
- Ready for both safe and agentic commands

**What this means**:
- ✅ Tier 1 commands use Gemini (fast, low-security)
- ✅ Tier 2 commands use Claude with strict voice auth + visual screening
- ✅ Maximum security enabled for computer use operations

---

## Example Full Startup Sequence

Here's what you'll hear during a typical JARVIS startup:

```
[... earlier startup announcements ...]

JARVIS: "Initializing two-tier security architecture."
[3 seconds pass]

JARVIS: "Agentic watchdog armed. Kill switch ready."
[2 seconds pass]

JARVIS: "Voice biometric authentication ready. Visual threat detection enabled."
[1 second pass]

JARVIS: "Cross-repository integration complete. Intelligence shared across all platforms."
[2 seconds pass]

JARVIS: "Two-tier security fully operational. I'm protected by voice biometrics and visual threat detection."

[... startup continues ...]

JARVIS: "JARVIS online. All systems operational."
```

**Total security announcement time**: ~10-15 seconds
**Announcements**: 5 security-related updates during startup

---

## New Startup Phases Added

### Added to `StartupPhase` Enum

```python
# v6.2: Enhanced VBIA Visual Security phases
VBIA_INIT = "vbia_init"
VISUAL_SECURITY = "visual_security"
CROSS_REPO_INIT = "cross_repo_init"
TWO_TIER_SECURITY = "two_tier_security"
```

### Narration Templates Added

Each phase has multiple voice templates for variety:

#### VBIA_INIT
- "Initializing voice biometric authentication."
- "Voice authentication systems coming online."
- "Preparing biometric security layer."
- *Complete*: "Voice biometric authentication fully operational."
- *Complete*: "VBIA ready. Multi-factor security enabled."

#### VISUAL_SECURITY
- "Enabling visual security analysis."
- "Initializing computer vision for threat detection."
- "Visual security systems coming online."
- *Complete*: "Visual security operational. I can now see potential threats."
- *Threat Detection*: "Visual threat detection is now active. I'll watch for ransomware and suspicious screens."

#### CROSS_REPO_INIT
- "Establishing cross-repository connections."
- "Connecting to JARVIS Prime and Reactor Core."
- *Complete*: "Cross-repository integration complete. All systems connected."
- *Complete*: "JARVIS, JARVIS Prime, and Reactor Core now operating in harmony."

#### TWO_TIER_SECURITY
- "Initializing two-tier security architecture."
- "Preparing dual-mode authentication system."
- *Watchdog*: "Agentic watchdog armed. Kill switch ready."
- *Complete*: "Two-tier security fully operational. Safe mode and agentic mode ready."
- *Visual Enhanced*: "Advanced protection active: voice authentication plus visual screening for tier two commands."

## Voice Announcement Strategy

### Pacing
- **Minimum interval between announcements**: 2-3 seconds
- **Smart batching**: Related announcements grouped together
- **Non-blocking**: Startup continues while speaking

### Priority
- **Security announcements**: HIGH priority
- **Completion announcements**: MEDIUM priority
- **Progress updates**: LOW priority (filtered)

### Adaptive Behavior
- If startup is fast (<30s): All announcements play
- If startup is slow (>60s): Only critical announcements
- If user is active: Reduces announcement volume

---

## Example Usage in Code

### How Announcements Are Triggered

```python
# In run_supervisor.py _initialize_agentic_security()

# 1. Initial announcement
if self.config.voice_enabled:
    await self.narrator.speak(
        "Initializing two-tier security architecture.",
        wait=False
    )

# 2. After watchdog initialization
if self.config.voice_enabled:
    await self.narrator.speak(
        "Agentic watchdog armed. Kill switch ready.",
        wait=False
    )

# 3. After VBIA initialization (dynamic based on visual security)
if self.config.voice_enabled:
    visual_enabled = os.getenv("JARVIS_VISUAL_SECURITY_ENABLED", "true").lower() == "true"
    if visual_enabled:
        await self.narrator.speak(
            "Voice biometric authentication ready. Visual threat detection enabled.",
            wait=False
        )
    else:
        await self.narrator.speak(
            "Voice biometric authentication ready. Tiered thresholds configured.",
            wait=False
        )

# 4. After cross-repo initialization
if self.config.voice_enabled:
    await self.narrator.speak(
        "Cross-repository integration complete. Intelligence shared across all platforms.",
        wait=False
    )

# 5. Final two-tier announcement (dynamic based on visual security)
if self.config.voice_enabled:
    visual_enabled = os.getenv("JARVIS_VISUAL_SECURITY_ENABLED", "true").lower() == "true"
    if visual_enabled:
        await self.narrator.speak(
            "Two-tier security fully operational. I'm protected by voice biometrics and visual threat detection.",
            wait=False
        )
    else:
        await self.narrator.speak(
            "Two-tier security fully operational. Safe mode and agentic mode ready.",
            wait=False
        )
```

## Testing the Narrator

### Manual Test

```bash
cd /Users/djrussell23/Documents/repos/JARVIS-AI-Agent

# Enable voice narrator
export STARTUP_NARRATOR_VOICE=true
export JARVIS_VISUAL_SECURITY_ENABLED=true

# Start JARVIS and listen for announcements
python3 run_supervisor.py
```

**Expected announcements** (in order):
1. "Initializing two-tier security architecture."
2. "Agentic watchdog armed. Kill switch ready."
3. "Voice biometric authentication ready. Visual threat detection enabled."
4. "Cross-repository integration complete. Intelligence shared across all platforms."
5. "Two-tier security fully operational. I'm protected by voice biometrics and visual threat detection."

### Test Without Visual Security

```bash
export JARVIS_VISUAL_SECURITY_ENABLED=false
python3 run_supervisor.py
```

**Expected change**:
- Announcement #3 becomes: "Voice biometric authentication ready. Tiered thresholds configured."
- Announcement #5 becomes: "Two-tier security fully operational. Safe mode and agentic mode ready."

### Disable Narrator

```bash
export STARTUP_NARRATOR_VOICE=false
python3 run_supervisor.py
```

**Expected**: No voice announcements (console output only)

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: No voice announcements

**Possible causes**:
1. `STARTUP_NARRATOR_VOICE=false` in environment
2. `self.config.voice_enabled=False` in config
3. macOS `say` command not available
4. Audio output muted/disconnected

**Solution**:
```bash
# Check environment variable
echo $STARTUP_NARRATOR_VOICE

# Enable narrator
export STARTUP_NARRATOR_VOICE=true

# Test 'say' command
say "Testing voice output"

# Restart JARVIS
```

### Issue: Announcements too fast/slow

**Solution**:
```bash
# Increase minimum interval (slower)
export STARTUP_NARRATOR_MIN_INTERVAL=5.0

# Decrease interval (faster)
export STARTUP_NARRATOR_MIN_INTERVAL=2.0

# Adjust speaking rate
export STARTUP_NARRATOR_RATE=170  # Slower
export STARTUP_NARRATOR_RATE=210  # Faster
```

### Issue: Wrong announcement for visual security

**Check**:
```bash
# Verify visual security setting
echo $JARVIS_VISUAL_SECURITY_ENABLED

# Should be "true" for visual security announcements
export JARVIS_VISUAL_SECURITY_ENABLED=true
```

### Potential Additions
1. **Visual Threat Announcements During Runtime**
   - "Visual threat detected on screen. Access denied."
   - "Ransomware pattern identified. Blocking unlock."

2. **Cross-Repo Event Announcements**
   - "JARVIS Prime has connected."
   - "Reactor Core analytics online."
   - "Threat analysis complete. Risk level: low."

3. **Authentication Feedback**
