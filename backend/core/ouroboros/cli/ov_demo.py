"""`ov demo` — watch the cockpit without paying for it.

Thirty-odd PRs of cockpit work shipped this month, verified by unit tests and
one PTY probe. Almost none of it has been WATCHED running, because seeing it
meant booting the organism and spending model calls to make something happen.

So this drives the real surfaces with synthetic events. No provider, no
network, no tokens. Two questions it answers that nothing else does:

  ``ov demo board``      where does `ov` actually STAND — live / dark / dynamic
  ``ov demo transcript`` what does the CC-style deck LOOK like

The rule that makes it worth having
-----------------------------------
It calls the SAME renderers the cockpit calls. A demo with its own draw path
is worse than no demo: it agrees with itself while the cockpit is broken, and
that is the exact defect shape this codebase has hit repeatedly — a fake
modelling a superseded seam, a producer with no consumer, a completer
implementing the one method the library never calls. Every one passed its own
tests.

So `moltbook_inline.render_thread`, `verb_description.to_operator_voice` and
`progress_board.render_board` are imported and called, never reimplemented. If
a renderer regresses, this regresses with it — which is the entire point.
