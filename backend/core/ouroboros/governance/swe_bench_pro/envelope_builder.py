"""SWE-Bench-Pro envelope builder — Phase 2 Phase B.2.1
(PRD §40.7.9 / §40.7.10-b21).

Pure-data composition layer: takes a ``ProblemSpec`` + ``PreparedProblem``
(both produced upstream by Phases A + B.1) and produces an
``IntentEnvelope`` ready for ``IntakeLayerService.ingest_envelope``.

Composition discipline
----------------------

  * **Composes existing canonical surfaces only**:
      - ``make_envelope`` (intake) — single source of truth for envelope
        construction; this module NEVER reaches IntentEnvelope's
        constructor directly.
      - ``EVIDENCE_REPO_ROOT_KEY`` (operation_advisor / B.2.0) — the
        canonical evidence key the B.2.0 worktree-aware advisor
        consumes. This module imports the constant rather than
        hardcoding the string "repo_root" so drift across the
        producer/consumer pair is structurally impossible.
      - ``_VALID_SOURCES`` (intent_envelope) — already extended in
        the same commit to include "swe_bench_pro". An AST pin in
        the B.2.1 spine asserts ``ENVELOPE_SOURCE`` is a member of
        ``_VALID_SOURCES`` so renames stay in sync.

  * **No master-flag gate inside the builder**: this layer is pure
    data composition with no side effects. The master flag
    (``swe_bench_pro_enabled()``) gates the side-effect-producing
    surfaces — the B.2.2 evaluator façade checks it before invoking
    ``ingest_envelope``. Separating responsibility this way keeps
    the builder unit-testable without env juggling and prevents the
    "flag drift across multiple layers" anti-pattern.

  * **Source-agnostic by design** (mirrors B.2.0's hardening note 4):
    every envelope from this builder carries ``source="swe_bench_pro"``.
    Downstream consumers MUST NOT branch on this source value to
    achieve correctness — they branch on observable envelope/context
    fields (target_files, evidence.repo_root, urgency, etc.). The
    source token exists for observability + dedup + WAL replay only.

  * **Honest urgency derivation**: ``_derive_urgency()`` is a
    deterministic helper backed by an env override
    (``JARVIS_SWE_BENCH_PRO_ENVELOPE_URGENCY``, default "normal" →
    routes STANDARD via UrgencyRouter). Trace-2 (soak
    bt-2026-05-17-225244): the prior "low" default gave the injected
    op the lowest priority-queue rank with deadline=inf, so it was
    structurally starved by the background-sensor flood and never
    dequeued. "normal" earns a finite deadline + starvation-guard
    protection. Operators wanting the old DW-only bulk economics can
    set the env to "low" explicitly (accepting the starvation risk for
    non-interactive bulk runs); "high"/"critical" → IMMEDIATE.

§7 fail-closed contract
-----------------------

Every public surface NEVER raises (``asyncio.CancelledError`` is the
sole exception that would propagate; this is a sync function so that's
moot in practice). Malformed inputs produce a degraded but valid
envelope rather than a partial construction that would fail downstream
validation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    problem:
        The :class:`ProblemSpec` produced by Phase A's dataset
        loader. Carries the problem statement, base commit, repo URL,
        and (separately) the failing-tests patch + gold patch (which
        the builder does NOT thread into the envelope — patches are
        worktree state, not envelope payload).
    prepared:
        The :class:`PreparedProblem` produced by Phase B.1's per-
        problem harness. Carries the worktree path, branch name, and
        the target_paths parsed from the test_patch's ``+++ b/<path>``
        headers.

    Returns
    -------
    IntentEnvelope
        A frozen envelope with ``source="swe_bench_pro"``, urgency
        derived deterministically, evidence dict assembled by
        :func:`_build_evidence`, and a fresh causal_id allocated by
        :func:`make_envelope`. The envelope is ready for the B.2.2
        evaluator façade to hand to
        ``IntakeLayerService.ingest_envelope``.

    Notes
    -----
    * The builder does NOT check the SWE-Bench-Pro master flag —
      it's pure data composition. The B.2.2 façade owns the master-
      flag gate before any side-effect-producing call.
    * The envelope's ``causal_id`` becomes the downstream
      ``OperationContext.op_id`` (see
      ``unified_intake_router.py:1159``). The B.2.2 façade reads
      this back AFTER construction to subscribe to the canonical
      ``operation_terminal`` SSE stream (B.2.0.5) filtered by
      ``op_id=envelope.causal_id``.
    * Every (problem × build) pair gets a fresh ``causal_id`` /
      ``idempotency_key``. Retries are distinct ops at the ledger
      level. The ``signature`` field (set to ``problem.instance_id``)
      drives router-side dedup so two near-simultaneous builds for
      the same problem don't both fire — only the first lands.
