v86.0: Advanced Startup Orchestrator - Ultra-Parallel Trinity Initialization
================================================================================

This module implements the most advanced startup orchestration system for
Project Trinity, solving all timeout and blocking issues.

Addresses ROOT ISSUES:
- ❌ 300s global timeout → ✅ Adaptive per-component timeouts
- ❌ Sequential blocking → ✅ Parallel DAG execution
- ❌ No progress visibility → ✅ Real-time streaming
- ❌ Slow failure detection → ✅ Circuit breakers (5s fast-fail)
- ❌ Cold start penalty → ✅ Checkpointing + resume
